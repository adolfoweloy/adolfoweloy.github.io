description: Searching an effective studying method
---

Some friends have already asked me how do I study. I know that I have a lot to improve and probably the way I study isn't the best way to go.
"So, why are you sharing this blog post?", one might ask. The purpose of this blog post is to put some thoughts about the way I am trying to use at the moment. It's something that I believe that might be effective based on some materials that I have been reading for some years and it's kind of my conclusions around the topic. By putting this "framework" here I believe that I would be able to remember the methodology I am trying to follow. Maybe in the future I can eventually come up with some collected metrics or even just more of my own opinion.

## 1 - Set up my study environment first

When I start studying something it's easy to get out of focus because of something I need, maybe a sheet of paper or even a cup of coffee. The idea at this stage is to grab everything I need which in my opinion shouldn't be too much things. After grabing everything needed, I just make sure that my environment is clean and without noise or distracting things. My table has to has just what I need.
One thing I would like to try to do is to change my phone to airplane mode. I don't want to be interrupted unless I am having a break (probably after a pomodoro session).

## 2 - Getting context

This step is important to avoid myself wondering throughout a lot of interesting subjects that has nothing to do with the real purpose of my study session. If I am studying about a specific AWS service (i.e. DynamoDB), I will check the topics that I would like to study, take some notes about the topics and objectives, collect some materials and after that I am ready to go for the study session.

## 3 - Studying

At this stage I start using the pomodoro timer and avoid any kind of distraction. Here I start using the discipline I have learned while reading the book Deep Work. During the study session, sometimes I can just identify something that I should read later or I can even remember about a side project that I would like to work. Instead of give importante to these thoughts I just add some notes into my backlog list on my Trello board and keep moving. Eventually I can go for it during the pomodoro break time (which can also be helpful to switch between focus and difuse modes of thinking).

## 4 - Finishing

At this point I take some notes or kind of create some exercises for me to do on the next day (might be even something to be used on my Getting context step for my next study session on next day).

## Conclusion

That's it. As I keep using this method and start getting some insights about it I will be update this page with more details.
