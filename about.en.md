I am a software engineer who likes to share tech related subjects throught blog posts, magazines and books. I have beend writing software over 10 years with experience with some different languages such as Java, Ruby, Python (basic knowledge yet), JavaScript, PHP5 and C language. I have also played with basic on early days and Visual Basic... but that was soooo long time ago.

I am interested in Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming, software engineering, Extreme Programming, Algorithms, Operational Systems... (computer science as a whole) and sometimes I spent my time making some draws, oil paintings, and sometimes I am surfing here in Brazil...

I am also the author of the following books
- OAuth 2.0: Proteja suas aplicações com o Spring Security OAuth2, available at [Casa do Código](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-oauth)
- OAuth 2.0 Cookbook available at [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/oauth-20-cookbook)
