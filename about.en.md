I am a software engineer who likes to share tech related subjects through blog posts, magazines and books. I have been writing software for more than 20 years now, using some different languages such as Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP5 and C language. I have also played with Basic on early days and Visual Basic... but that was soooo long time ago.

I am interested in Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming, Software Engineering, Extreme Programming, Algorithms, Operational Systems (honestly computer science in general). Sometimes I spend my time drawing, painting or surfing in ~~Brazil~~ Australia.

I am also the author of the following books
- **OAuth 2.0: Proteja suas aplicações com o Spring Security OAuth2** (book in Portuguese), available at [Casa do Código](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-oauth).
This book is intended for developers who want to understand in detail how the OAuth 2.0 specification works without the need to read the whole RFC 6749. The details of the specification are explained while an example application is built and protected with OAuth 2.0 gradually. The purpose of this book is also to present how Spring Security OAuth2 works behind the scenes so you can understand how to customize what you want.

- **OAuth 2.0 Cookbook** (book in English) available at [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/oauth-20-cookbook).
This book has a different approach and is aimed at developers who have some experience with OAuth 2.0 protocol. It's a cookbook format (recipe based in a problem-solution approach) which presents how to add social login, implement an OAuth 2.0 authorisation server, how to add support for dynamic client registration as well as to protect mobile apps (Android).
