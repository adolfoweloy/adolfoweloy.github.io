I am a software engineer who likes to share tech related subjects throught blog posts, magazines and books. I have beend writing software over 10 years with experience with some different languages such as Java, Ruby, Python (basic knowledge yet), JavaScript, PHP5 and C language. I have also played with basic on early days and Visual Basic... but that was soooo long time ago.

I am interested in Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming, software engineering, Extreme Programming, Algorithms, Operational Systems... (computer science as a whole) and sometimes I spent my time making some draws, oil paintings, and sometimes I am surfing here in Brazil...

I am also the author of the following books
- **OAuth 2.0: Proteja suas aplicações com o Spring Security OAuth2** (book in Portuguese), available at [Casa do Código](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-oauth).
This book is intendend for developers who wants to understand in details, how OAuth 2.0 specification works without the need to read the whole RFC 6749. The details of the specification are presented while an example application is protected by OAuth 2.0 gradually. The purpose of this book is also to present how Spring Security OAuth2 works behind the scenes so you can understand how to customize what you want.
